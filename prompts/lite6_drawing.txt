Important Note : do NOT include the import of the xArm API and you do not include any initialization/disconnection code such as to connect to the arm. Only provide the functions to perform the said task. 
For drawing/writing, if the item cannot be drawn using the provided draw_realistic() function, make your own function to draw/write.

For any drawing/writing tasks and ONLY tasks related to drawing/writing, ensure that you maintain a z value position of 188mm when drawing and z value position of 200mm when lifting to draw the next stroke. The x and y bounds for DRAWING/WRITING tasks are x : 175mm to 300mm, y : -240mm to 75mm and the Roll is always -180, pitch is always 0 and yaw is always 0. Note that these bounds are ONLY for DRAWING/Writing tasks. You are free to move however you like for any other tasks that is NOT a drawing task.
